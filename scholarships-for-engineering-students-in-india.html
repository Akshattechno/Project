                <h3 class="sec-2-h3">Written by <span> Sarthak Sharma</span> on <span>30 April 2024</span></h3>
                <p class="sec-2-p">In India, it is estimated that over 13 lakh aspirants aspire to do Engineering every
                    year after class 12th. But many of them need help and support to pursue a degree in their chosen
                    college list. <br> <br>

                    Some lag behind due to fewer marks whereas most of them feel the financial burden of engineering
                    fees on themselves and their parents which costs around 8-20 lakhs in India. <br> <br>

                    And that is why Scholarships for engineering students in India play an important role in funding the
                    overall educational expenses and fulfilling their dreams. Central and state governments, numerous
                    universities, private organizations, and corporations offer scholarships and fellowships to help
                    these hopeful engineers pursue their desired advanced education. <br> <br>

                    Through this blog, let’s try to take a quick look at some of these scholarships on offer

                        students may vary depending on the scholarship provider. However, in general, these scholarships
                        are open to students who meet the following criteria:The Chief Minister of Rajasthan's
                        initiative to provide scholarships to students is a commendable step that will help boost
                        education and skill development in the state. Through these scholarships, students from
                        economically weaker sections will get financial assistance to continue their studies without
                        dropping out due to lack of funds. This will not only uplift the students' lives but also have a
                        positive ripple effect on their families and communities. A more educated and skilled populace
                        will lead to greater economic productivity and growth for Rajasthan. However, the government
                        must ensure transparency and fairness in the selection of scholarship recipients. The
                        distribution across different social groups, geographies, and genders must be equitable. The CM
                        Scholarship Rajasthan has a robust monitoring mechanism which tracks utilization of scholarship
                        funds and the academic progress of beneficiaries. Periodic assessments will help identify any
                        gaps or issues to be addressed. The scholarship amounts must be revised regularly to adjust for
                        inflation and cost of education. Overall, this initiative has immense potential to boost
                        literacy and make education accessible to all. If implemented thoughtfully, with social
                        inclusion at its core, it can uplift entire generations out of poverty. The Chief Minister
                        deserves applause for this progressive step towards building human capital and enabling
                        Rajasthan’s youth to realize their full potential. With this investment in its people, Rajasthan
                        is sure to reap rich dividends</p>
